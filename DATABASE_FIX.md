# 🚨 Quick Database Fix

Your workout tracker app is showing a blank screen because the database tables haven't been created yet.

## ✅ What I've Fixed

1. **Fixed HomeScreen.tsx** - Resolved the `exerciseLibrary.map is not a function` error
2. **Created database verification script** - You can now run `npm run check-db` to check your database status
3. **Confirmed Supabase connection** - Your .env file is correctly configured

## 🔧 What You Need to Do (2 minutes)

The database tables need to be created in your Supabase project:

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to: https://bytevshrarptzmdfbmce.supabase.co
2. Sign in to your Supabase account

### Step 2: Create Database Tables
1. Click on **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
2. Open the file `database-schema.sql` in this project
3. **Copy ALL the contents** (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
4. **Paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor** (Ctrl+V)
5. Click the **"Run"** button (green play button)

### Step 3: Verify Setup
```bash
npm run check-db
```

This should now show:
```
✅ profiles - OK
✅ workouts - OK  
✅ body_weights - OK
✅ exercises - OK
✅ user_exercises - OK
```

### Step 4: Test Your App
```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app should now work correctly! 🎉

## 📋 What The Schema Creates

- **`workouts`** - Stores your exercise entries (reps, weight, date)
- **`exercises`** - Global library of exercises (pre-populated with 15 common exercises)
- **`user_exercises`** - Your personal exercise library with custom names
- **`profiles`** - Your user profile information  
- **`body_weights`** - Body weight tracking entries

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If you still see errors after running the schema:

1. **Clear browser cache** - Refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Check console** - Open browser developer tools and look for errors
3. **Verify tables** - Run `npm run check-db` again
4. **Authentication** - Try signing out and back in

## ⚡ Quick Test

After setup, try this:
1. Sign up with any email (e.g., `test@example.com`) and password
2. Add an exercise to your library (e.g., "Bench Press")  
3. Log a workout entry
4. Check that it appears in your recent workouts

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

The most common issues:
- **Still getting 404s**: The SQL schema wasn't run completely - try running it again
- **Permission errors**: Make sure you're signed in to the correct Supabase project
- **"Email not confirmed"**: Go to Authentication → Settings and turn OFF "Enable email confirmations"
